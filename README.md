# Advice Generator App created in React ![Green Light Bulb](/public/favicon-32x32.png)

This is one of two “advice generator apps”. Both look the same but this app was created in React and the second one in Vanilla JS (you can find the link here [https://github.com/basiakedz/advice-generator-app-main](https://github.com/basiakedz/advice-generator-app-main) to compare them). Making two similar apps but in different ways allowed me to see the difference between using Vanilla JS and React (which is easier to implement in my opinion).

This app is using the [Advice Slip API](https://api.adviceslip.com).
Users can generate a new piece of advice by clicking on the dice icon and save the best quotes in favourite list, so that they can come back to them anytime they want.
